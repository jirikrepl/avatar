  // IMPORTANT:
  //
  // React support is being removed from this project for the time being. The latest updates to Meteor and
  // the React package have made the build unstable, and despite my best efforts I haven't been able to
  // create a single solution that works with both apps that use and don't use React.
  //
  // This will be revisited once Meteor 1.2 is out, or else a separate React fork may be considered.
  //
  // To add support for React we can need to weak link to it so that it's not uncessarily included
  // However we have to force the inclusion of the jsx compiler otherwise our jsx files aren't included.
  // Since JSX is only used when compiling and it isn't delivered to clients this isn't an issue, even for
  // those who aren't using React in their project.

  // api.use('jsx@0.1.5');
  // api.use('react@0.1.7', { weak: true });
  // api.use('react-meteor-data@0.1.5');
